        "This code implements a simple blackjack environment that follows basic rules. Let's break down the approach used in this code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization** (`__init__` method):\n",
        "   - The `BlackJack` class is initialized with attributes such as the deck of cards, player's and dealer's hands, game status flags, scores, balance, and bet.\n",
        "   - The deck is represented as a list of cards, where each card is represented by its value ('2' to '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'), and it is initialized with four copies of each card.\n",
        "   - Other attributes such as `player_hand`, `dealer_hand`, `game_over`, `player_stand`, `dealer_stand`, `state`, `reward`, `player_score`, `dealer_score`, `balance`, and `bet` are initialized accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Resetting the Environment** (`reset` method):\n",
        "   - This method resets the game to its initial state.\n",
        "   - It reshuffles the deck, deals two cards each to the player and the dealer, and sets various attributes accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Placing Bets** (`place_bet` method):\n",
        "   - This method allows the player to place a bet before starting the game.\n",
        "   - It checks if the player has sufficient balance and deducts the bet amount from the balance if valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Calculating Scores** (`calculate_score` method):\n",
        "   - This method calculates the score of a given hand according to the rules of blackjack.\n",
        "   - Face cards ('J', 'Q', 'K') count as 10, and 'Aces' can count as 1 or 11 depending on the situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Updating Balance** (`update_balance` method):\n",
        "   - This method updates the player's balance based on the game outcome (win, lose, draw).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Player's Turn** (`player_turn` method):\n",
        "   - This method handles the player's turn, allowing them to either 'hit' (request another card) or 'stand' (stop requesting cards).\n",
        "   - It updates the player's hand and score accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Dealer's Turn** (`dealer_turn` method):\n",
        "   - This method handles the dealer's turn, where the dealer must hit until they reach a score of 17 or more.\n",
        "   - It updates the dealer's hand and score accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Taking a Step** (`step` method):\n",
        "   - This method takes a step in the game based on the player's action.\n",
        "   - It updates the game state and returns the new state and reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Checking the Winner** (`check_winner` method):\n",
        "   - This method determines the winner of the game based on the final scores.\n",
        "   - It returns a message indicating the outcome of the game (player wins, dealer wins, draw, or bust).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Main Functionality** (`main` function):\n",
        "    - This function runs the main game loop.\n",
        "    - It allows the player to place bets and take actions (hit or stand) until the game is over.\n",
        "    - After each round, it displays the game status, including player and dealer hands, scores, rewards, and balance.\n",
        "    - It checks if the player wants to cash out or if they have run out of balance to end the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this approach provides a simple yet comprehensive implementation of a blackjack environment where a player can interact with the game and play against a dealer. The code is well-structured and modular, making it easy to understand and extend with additional rules or functionalities."
